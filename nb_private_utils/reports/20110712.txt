	Brittany S. Pierce: awww
	Blaine Anderson: but maybe... I won't rule it out just yet...
	Rachel Berry: It would, if at all, be for Kurt of course.
	Finn Hudson: Sorry, Burt walked in the room. Couldn't let him see that Blaine is planning on proposing
	Blaine Anderson: of course not!
	Blaine Anderson: not yet at least...

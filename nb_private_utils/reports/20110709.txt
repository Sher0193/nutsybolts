Room 5808 (Space Game)
Round 0 of 150
Players:
	Space (47599)

Chat list:
	Space: Hello. We will begin once we have at least three players, so there can be one judge, and two possible people to get the point for each round. 
	Space: If we had two players, there would be one judge, and one possible person to get the point for each round.
	Space: They would automatically win that round, and the point of a game is to have a less than 100% probability of someone wining. 
	Space: If there was one person, this game could not be played, because the rules state that this is a multiplayer game.
	Space: Game terminated.  Reason: Game is inactive, so it is not likely that other players will join.

Chat list:
	Proto: Well it seems I got here rather early.
	rossdude: aye
	rossdude: ok let's see if we can make this work
	Haifisch: Let's see if the room name makes the game work
	rossdude: damnit proto
	Haifisch: We already have a casualty at round one :(
	rossdude: seems to be alright otherwise...
	Haifisch: maybe the secret is to have no more than three people playing at a time
	rossdude: that might be it
	rossdude: good ol' round 6, haven't seen you in a while
	GORE POPE: I sure do have a shitty hand of cards
	Haifisch: don't worry, you'll get a point someday
	Haifisch: probably
	GORE POPE: 30 round loops of me not getting points
	Haifisch: oh hey, it's breaking a bit already
	Haifisch: try refreshing
	Haifisch: Valex!
	Haifisch: The game's not breaking yet! (mostly)
	Valex: hi haifisch!
	Valex: oh man this is gonna be my first full game in ages
	rossdude: yeah, look, round 13!
	Valex: GO US
	Valex: i mean it's breaking already cause that last message popped up 3 times
	Valex: BUT STILL
	rossdude: hahaha oh no
	Haifisch: at least the game itself is working
	rossdude: it's like it can only hold so many people in a room at a time
	Haifisch: and the limit is apparently three
	Haifisch: aka the most boring number of people to play with
	Valex: lol
	Valex: at least it's something
	Haifisch: (I suppose two would be even worse, but that's not really a game)
	Valex: three would be the least you could play with and it'd be terrible
	Valex: 4 isn't that bad
	Haifisch: smaller rooms are kind of refreshing since they go so quickly
	Valex: oh man i can't beat diddling kids
	rossdude: quite frankly i'm tired of refreshing
	Haifisch: as opposed to clusterfucks with 8+ people where there's always one person who needs to play a goddamned card
	Valex: yeah that's true
	GORE POPE: wait a goddamn minute
	GORE POPE: when did this become the rossdude power hour
	Haifisch: LACK
	Valex: uh round 2 by the looks of it
	lack: any luck?
	Haifisch: the game is actually working
	Haifisch: too bad it's already halfway over
	Valex: hi lack!
	Valex: yeah we're actually having beautiful luck so fart
	Valex: *far
	rossdude: i am in a constant state of prayer hoping that it won't break
	Haifisch: clearly the room name has caused everything to align correctly
	Valex: i guess the prayer is why you won 8 rounds
	Haifisch: so there is a sky wizard?!?
	Haifisch: I should ask him to give me a motorcycle so I'm not stuck with city buses anymore
	Haifisch: unless his powers are only strong enough to assist in nutsy botls
	Valex: yeah and i'd like some money plz
	rossdude: i wonder if the next game will work as well as this one
	Valex: oh man that'd be fantastic
	lack: dont fucking jinx it
	Haifisch: obviously the next room needs to be called "THE GAME IS BROKEN" so that the game already thinks it's broken and thus won't bother to break anymore
	Valex: yeah that's a good idea
	rossdude: i think it's more promising to use titles like "NO PROBLEMS HERE"
	Haifisch: next room title will be "ROOM TITLE"
	Valex: i'd also love to get good cards but we can't always get what we want in life
	Haifisch: just to use a nice in-between point
	rossdude: that's not a bad idea fisch
	rossdude: walk the neutral line
	rossdude: this game is less about playing and more about strategizing ways to make the game work now
	Valex: haha
	Haifisch: we must find a legion of internet spergs to find the optimal room title. They will spend their days creating rooms over and over for the sole purpose of finding the least-broken title.
	Valex: where do i sign up???
	Haifisch: you can start RIGHT NOW!!!
	Valex: WOOOOO
	Haifisch: start with the letter "A" and work your way up from there
	Haifisch: make sure to hit the special characters too
	Haifisch: I have a good feeling about a room titled "}"
	Valex: haha
	Valex: i doubt anyone's gonna wanna play in a room called asf[po,';l,g
	rossdude: sounds intriguing to me
	Valex: WELL IN THAT CASE
	Haifisch: taking down the reign of rossdude one point at a time
	Valex: you go haifisch
	rossdude: *glare*
	Haifisch: so are you guys up for another room afte this? (SINCE THE GAME IS WORKING FOR A CHANGE)
	Valex: sure
	lack: yep
	rossdude: mhm
	Haifisch: www.nutsybolts.com/invite.php/3732/lljk
	Haifisch: new room

	Dave Karofsky: it was fine before you got here lopez. I wasnt even being mean
	Santana Lopez: Hard to believe
	Dave Karofsky: Shut up hopez
	Blaine Anderson: Do we have to put you in separate corners?
	Rachel Berry: I thought you two were happily in love?
	Santana Lopez: (so wtf happened in the fandom while I was showering? Did plot lines get leaked cause my tumblr is going nuts)
	Dave Karofsky: uh./.. yeah... about that? im breaking up with you Santana. 
	Brittany S. Pierce: (If they did, I DO NOT want to know.)
	Finn Hudson: whoooh snap
	Santana Lopez: Dude, we were never together
	Kurt Hummel: Talk about a sucky breakup
	Santana Lopez: Remember?
	Santana Lopez: Or were you too busy replaying your kiss with Kurt to think straight?
	Rachel Berry: (I think it was Cory's ET interview)
	Santana Lopez: ... Or should I say gay?
	Dave Karofsky: ...
	Santana Lopez: (OHHH! Anyone got a link for the interview?)
	Noah Puckerman: oh snap.
	Blaine Anderson: oh snap!
	Finn Hudson: ... whoh dude.
	Dave Karofsky: i should have never come on here
	Finn Hudson: is that true
	Noah Puckerman: I knew it.
	Santana Lopez: Smartest words to come out of your mouth Karofsky
	Brittany S. Pierce: Well, if we're outing people... SANTANA PLAYS FOR BOTH TEAMS.
	Rachel Berry: (I don't have it yet, but if I scroll past it I will post it)
	Dave Karofsky: you loser glee kids believe whatever you want from hopez
	Rachel Berry: ....Dave..if that is true you have no reason to feel threatened by us knowing.
	Blaine Anderson: Since everyone is coming clean... I like boys.. well one certain boy...
	Finn Hudson: (the interview was so random he didnt even say much. and yeah maybe he did some stuff in the past but look how far hes come)
	Noah Puckerman: We know, Blaine
	Santana Lopez: Awww <3
	Finn Hudson: I like boobs
	Kurt Hummel: Aww I like a certain bow too <3
	Noah Puckerman: Me too
	Kurt Hummel: BOY*
	Blaine Anderson: I like Kurt's tush!
	Dave Karofsky: well i was going to come on here and come clean but hopez had to ruin it
	Santana Lopez: (Seriously! I'm sure he isn't the ONLY person in the WORLD with some sort of sketch past)
	Finn Hudson: (and defending cory for finn. tho i just like finn as a character because he is hillarious to play)
	Kurt Hummel: LOL Blaine I like yours too
	Blaine Anderson: <3
	Santana Lopez: Hey Karofsky?
	Dave Karofsky: (yeah and he got his life back on track anyways)
	Dave Karofsky: what?
	Santana Lopez: Kurt isn't gonna like you no matter how many people you come out to.
	Santana Lopez: Just so you know.
	Dave Karofsky: yeah well brittany is never going to leave the kid in the wheelchair for you
	Santana Lopez: So you can probably just take that sad little fantasy and cry yourself to sleep
	Finn Hudson: hey dude. if you were gay.. that would be ok... cus i mean hey id like you anyway
	Blaine Anderson: If you were queer, I'd still be here!
	Dave Karofsky: What is this? 
	Kurt Hummel: ^why I like bringing Finn to see Touring Productions
	Dave Karofsky: are you singing??
	Kurt Hummel: Because you see
	Rachel Berry: (: It's true Dave.  If anything it would help us to understand you better and what happened between you and Kurt (even though it was still really wrong).
	Kurt Hummel: If it were me I would feel free to say that I was gay!
	Santana Lopez: (1: Being Santana is BOMB, I love it! 2: I'm definitely a Klainer, can you tell? 3: Kurtofsky better NEVER happen!)
	Kurt Hummel: Because I'm gay
	Finn Hudson: but im not gay
	Santana Lopez: Finn, pick a card woman!
	Finn Hudson: its not flipping
	Finn Hudson: and im a guy!
	Santana Lopez: Refresh??
	Finn Hudson: kurt has to pick
	Santana Lopez: He's too busy staring at the Warbler's ass
	Rachel Berry: (Haha!  I imagine she'd be fun to play as a bitch.)
	Blaine Anderson: ...
	Noah Puckerman: LOL
	Rachel Berry: ...WHO PUT BROADWAY MUSICALS?!?!?!?!
	Santana Lopez: ...
	Rachel Berry: ...SANTANA. ):
	Kurt Hummel: Sorry it's right beside me so i cant help it *shrug*
	Santana Lopez: Your love for them IS unnatural, Berry
	Finn Hudson: and we had to sing. it is a glee chatroom
	Dave Karofsky: yeah but it was a little weird
	Rachel Berry: It is NOT unnatural.  
	Santana Lopez: ...
	Blaine Anderson: it seems quite natural to me
	Finn Hudson: you are a little weird
	Rachel Berry: Thank you, Blaine.
	Rachel Berry: (:
	Blaine Anderson: you're welcome, Rachel
	Santana Lopez: Warblers SHOULD ship Klaine!
	Rachel Berry: WOOOOO. (:
	Dave Karofsky: klaine?
	Kurt Hummel: They do P:
	Santana Lopez: Hey Blaine?
	Noah Puckerman: They so do.
	Blaine Anderson: Yes, Santana?
	Finn Hudson: dude. kurt and blaine. get in the loop
	Dave Karofsky: sorry im not in your little club or anything
	Santana Lopez: What grade are you in?
	Santana Lopez: Cause I thought you were a year older than Kurt, but you didn't graduate last year... What gives?
	Finn Hudson: dude! you should like totally join!
	Santana Lopez: How come Klaine only gets one child and Finchel gets children?!
	Blaine Anderson: I'm going into my senior year, Santana
	Santana Lopez: Wanky Puckerman
	Finn Hudson: (guys u all know its confirmed that blaine is younger than kurt? lol)
	Finn Hudson: (blaine isnt a senior lol)
	Blaine Anderson: (Huuu?)
	Kurt Hummel: (NO WAY THAT HAS TO BE A LIE)
	Noah Puckerman: (I thought they were gonna make them both juniors...)
	Santana Lopez: (WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK?! HOW IN THE FUCKING HELL WAS HE KURTS MENTOR?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!!?!?!?!?)
	Brittany S. Pierce: (I've given up on continuity for this show.)
	Finn Hudson: (apparantly sam and blaine for sure are not seniors i dont know the rest)
	Rachel Berry: (Let's just all assume that no one actually knows the ages of the characters, even if they've been "confirmed" haha.)
	Noah Puckerman: (no way they'd have chris leave after this season and keep darren for S4)
	Kurt Hummel: (I FUCKING LOVE GLEE. YOUNGER PEOPLE CAN TOTALLY BE MENTORS)
	Kurt Hummel: (This is true)
	Dave Karofsky: (lol karofsky was taking calculus but didnt graduate. wtf)
	Kurt Hummel: (Kurt could have totally been a freshman; id believe it)
	Santana Lopez: (I've heard that Kurt was gonna graduate! Although, I'd LOVE him to be a junior and Bliane to be a junior because then there'd be Klaine for a year longer than I thought!)
	Finn Hudson: (but they all went to junior prom so....?)
	Blaine Anderson: (Wasn't it said somewhere that Kurt was supposed to be the youngest out of all of the kids?)
	Noah Puckerman: (at our Junior prom, there were sophomores there too)
	Finn Hudson: (yeah they keep changing everything)
	Santana Lopez: (He would have to have been a freshman in season one though, so a sophomore in season 2, and then a junior in season 3...)
	Kurt Hummel: (Finn, he could've been given a ticket or two; it's possible)
	Brittany S. Pierce: (I don't want anyone to graduate. :( )
	Noah Puckerman: (me neither *sadface*)
	Blaine Anderson: (but I suppose he had to have been at least 16 S1, which would make him a sophmore most likely..)
	Finn Hudson: (but they ran as prom king and queen so they must have been juniors at least those who ran)
	Kurt Hummel: (I'd be perfect with Rachel Graduating :/)
	Santana Lopez: (Okay, so I thought Blaine had been at Dalton for two years ater being bullied his freshman year, thus making him class of 2011, which he isn't)

	Rachel Berry: (Ohhhh!! All right. Haha.)
	Rachel Berry: Oh.  My apologies, Santana.  I thought you were trying to...nevermind.

	Rachel Berry: We'll just see about that!
	Rachel Berry: Kurt you can keep it.  Finn and I won't be needing it any longer, at least for a LONG while.
	Kurt Hummel: Uh oh, trouble in Finchel paradise?
	Blaine Anderson: I'm so glad we don't have relationship drama, like they do!
	Kurt Hummel: Mhm, instead of arguing, we just get to have more Klex!

	Blaine Anderson: We never said you couldn't...
	Santana Lopez: Speaking of Klex...
	Santana Lopez: Finn, can I come over?
	Blaine Anderson: NO!
	Blaine Anderson: You are not going to watch us have klex!
	Finn Hudson: oh god not again
	Santana Lopez: Prudes
	Finn Hudson: are you having klex tonight? because i think you owe me baked goods first. like cookies. or a cake. 
	Santana Lopez: I wish there were more hot gay guys in Lima... Ones who wouldn't mind an audience
	Kurt Hummel: Only if Blaine considers driving here
	Santana Lopez: I'm all sorts of worked up
	Finn Hudson: you know. so i dont accidently tell burt
	Sam Evans: Great. Now I'm hungry too.
	Blaine Anderson: Well, Kurt, you could always come over my house
	Kurt Hummel: And Finn, there are already cookies downstairs, I made them this afternoon, remember?
	Finn Hudson: yeah i had some earlier... i think they are gone....
	Kurt Hummel: Don't tempt me, Anderson, I'd have to go find my keys
	Finn Hudson: oh cus you can find your keys. where the heck are mine
	Kurt Hummel: finn, did you check in between the couch?
	Finn Hudson: uhhh no
	Kurt Hummel: And I could; I'd just have to go through about six pairs of jeans
	Finn Hudson: i didnt really look yet
	Rachel Berry: Late comment: From what I can say, I am very happy with Finn's body. 
	Finn Hudson: YAY! thanks rachel!
	Blaine Anderson: Well I could come over your house, but then I'd have to find my clothes.. I don't know if it would be appropriate to drive over in just my boxers...
	Sam Evans: Why are you naked, Anderson?
	Blaine Anderson: It's really hot out! Nobody's home! Who cares?
	Santana Lopez: ... How long does it take to drive from Lima to Westerfeld again?
	Sam Evans: Alright, sheesh. Just asking.
	Kurt Hummel: Oh Grilled Cheesus on rye, that image

	Grif: Okay so... we're stuck in here.
	Grif: Does anybody not know how to play this game? 
	Zouichi: Hi. 
	Minatsuki: I think I understand the rules, mostly... I'm sorry in advance if I hold the game up.
	Allenby: Hey Z!
	JadeHarley: Umm, I think I know how! It's not one of the games I used to play a lot, though.
	Howard: Hey, Grif, you stole my start keys.
	Kang: It's relatively easy to play.
	Howard: Jerk.
	Grif: I stole your what?
	Kang: Why GLaDOS is making us do it, though, I have no damn idea.
	Grif: It's a test.
	Grif: It's always a test.
	Grif: Just be glad you missed the mistletoe.
	Minatsuki: S-sultry...?
	JadeHarley: I don't think this sounds like a bad test, though! It seems really fun! 
	Allenby: I have no good cards.

	JadeHarley: They're reptiles, aren't they? 
	Howard: I guess they have cold blood?
	JadeHarley: That means that they're cold blooded!
	Homura Akemi: Cold blood.
	Peter: Hey,if you're gonna try to punch me, expect retaliation.
	Grif: Dinosaurs aren't lizards.
	Grif: They kind of are. But they're special.
	Howard: Oh, and the fact that they EAT PEOPLE ALIVE.
	Grif: Right, Kang?
	Howard: Aren't they still cold-blooded?
	Grif: Maybe they are? [shrugs]
	Minatsuki: They're extinct now, though, so...
	Peter: Considering how closely related to birds they are? Possibly not.
	Kang: ...cold-blooded doesn't mean the blood is actually cold.
	Grif: Somebody poke Kang and report.
	Grif: I'd do it but he'd kill me.
	Allenby: /POKES
	Grif: Is he cold?
	Minatsuki: Akemi-san, are you all right?
	Allenby: Nope!
	Allenby: Dorm rooms are though.
	Howard: *throws syringes at a dart board*
	Allenby: Stupid cheapskates with the thermostat
	Peter: Being cold-blooded means you can't maintain internal body temperature through metabolism.
	Kang: I'm glad someone paid attention in Biology.
	Peter: Which is why lizards lay in the sun.
	Howard: I never got to Biology class. /tiny violin

	jj: hahahaha i want to see the moms and kids that signed right after
	assplay: I should have taken a pic
	jj: um.. yeah!
	clem: that's amazing
	assplay: it was abstract enough where unless you knew what docking was, you wouldn't quite get it
	jj: hahaha it was a secret code made just for you
	clem: it was probably plas or somebody that drew it
	clem: right before he murdered those people
	assplay: i became engorged, its true
	jj: well, now i know what i will try to do next time i have to sign any sort of guest book
	clem: haha lolshinola?

	jj: i like him, but i still laugh at him all the time
	clem: yes
	RunLikeAPossum: don't know shinola.  needed to get rid of that card
	clem: he basically advertised that he was giving away all the SBDS on the msg board
	clem: so thats probably where the lol comes from
	RunLikeAPossum: gotcha
	jj: no idea
	assplay: is primitive
	jj: lol sorry i was trying to find a rubber stamp of docking
	jj: and the results did not come out as naughty as i had hoped the "rrubber" part would yield
	clem: holy shit i just looked up real pics of docking
	clem: ouch
	assplay: yeah.  I need to find a line drawing of it....I'm not sure I wanna make one myself from a photo.  Actually...hrm.

	Space: The Metric System?! Psh. 
	Space: I bet, the person who picked that, hates change.
	Elonna: Or just is american.
	Space: No, I disagree, because most of America uses the metric system.
	Tim: Really? I didn't know that.
	Space: Well, now you know.
	Tim: lol
	Elonna: is kylie here? her name is italiced?
	Space: What?  The United States is the only major country that does not use the Metric System, but the rest of America, which is North and South America, uses the Metric System.
	Tim: Oh, by America I meant USA. I'm canadian
	Tim: woohoo
	Space: Kylie is not here.  Also, "her name is italiced" is not a question.  Learn English.
	TamponKing: Vote to skip and lets move on
	Elonna: I meant it in a questioning sense, as in "I may be wrong, but". That is a proper usage for a question mark.
	Elonna: But whatever floats your boat.
	Space: It may have been in a questioning sense, but the correct way to write it would be, "Is Kylie here? Here name is italiced."
	Space: My boat?  It is everyones' boat, who at least knows proper English.
	Space: Her*
	TamponKing: Tim's gone lets skip him please
	Elonna: Whatever makes you feel good about yourself. I am not one to judge the rationale of one's superiority complex.
	Space: Alright, however I am simply informing you that you are incorrect.
	Elonna: And I am simply informing you that I hear your objections and disregard them.
	Space: Alright.  Honestly, I do not care what you do with what I tell you, as long as I know I put in the effort to attempt to help someone.
	Arianna: I think she left... :/
	Space: I know she left.  I still responded because of the case in which she may return.
	Arianna: No, I mean we should skip her. But I think someone already did.
	Space: Well, she is skipped now.  It is time for the game to continue.

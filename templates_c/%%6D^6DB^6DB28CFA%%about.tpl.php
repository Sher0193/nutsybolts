		<p>Nutsy Bolts is a multi-player browser game of fun, randomness, absurdity, and awesomesauce.  What more need be said?</p> 
		
		<p>Nutsy Bolts is the brainchild of Mark Goetz, who is the designer, programmer, maintainer, benevolent dictator, and all-around awesome guy behind it.  Mark would also like to thank those who suffered the indignity of testing its early stages, including (but not limited to) Chad Behnke, Liz Blankenship, Michelle Cummings, Orin Davis, Michelle Davis, Katie Dover-Taylor, Melissa Fichter, Jackie Frank, Joel Frank, Josh Gerrish, Leanna Gingras, Kurt Goetz, Alex Goldman, Noah Liebman, Becky Lieberman, Andrea McVittie, Dan Menna, Brenda Salem, Tova Searleman, John Theiss, and Lauren Wendel.  I'd also like to thank <a href="http://hosting.jlauser.net/" target="_blank">jlauser.net hosting</a> for hosting the site.
		
		<p>Nutsy Bolts is a one-man operation, which I'm paying for out of my own pocket.  As such, I rely on the help of people just like you.  If Nutsy Bolts has made you laugh even once, consider making a small donation.  Even a dollar helps - you've probably spent more on coffee that wasn't this awesome!</p>

	bredes: wait you can skeip breida. that was my other one
	Umbree: I like sausage pizza occasionally
	Umbree: Pepperoni is disgusting, however.
	elvira: umbree.... cheese pizza is code for child pr0nz....
	anon404: elvira, i herd u liek mudkipz... is there any truth to that?
	Umbree: Oh is it now.
	Umbree: I am disappoint in such malicious thinking
	elvira: based god likes mudkipz
	Umbree: I should have to report this to the party van.

	anon404: FUCK YES COCAINE
	elvira: i'm down.
	Umbree: I have a question
	Umbree: So did you take down the PSN network yourself?
	bredes: i may have an answer
	anon404: well...
	anon404: anon really never said that we took it down
	anon404: however, I did find lulz with the raging psnfags
	bredes: who didnt put their card in
	anon404: I personally am an xboxfag myself.
	elvira: you, bredes xD
	Umbree: Correction
	Umbree: xbro.
	anon404: bredes, get with the fucking program. lol
	bredes: no. i put mine in. 
	elvira: anon has become..... cheapened, i think
	Trigger: just cause they didn't take credit doesn't mean they didn't do it.
	bredes: i already put mine in. i did santa claus
	anon404: well...
	elvira: everyone is on the anon boat "i'm a hackzor lolz" and its, idk, not the same
	elvira: whine whine whine
	anon404: i mean if you want to become technical...
	elvira: thanks for telling us, bredes xD
	anon404: you need to define the term anon...
	anon404: are you referring to anon as the anons from the website we all know of...
	anon404: or just anon as EVERYBODY on the internet?
	Umbree: Don't talk about anon, what the frick.
	Trigger: 4chan, 7chan, etc.
	Umbree: That's against the rules.
	Trigger: You don't have to hide the name lol.
	anon404: Umbree, lrn2rules
	elvira: we're all friends here
	Trigger: No, you don't talk about /b/, only on raids
	anon404: I can talk about anon.
	anon404: herp derp
	elvira: talking about anon is what ruined it yeahhh
	anon404: and besides that, we are all seeming to be /b/ros here...
	Umbree: Actually
	elvira: skip bredes?
	Trigger: lol yep, once anon got that "anon is superior" mentality the whole community got a lot less impressive
	Umbree: If you want to know the truth
	Trigger: and now they're just trying to live up to V's fictional legacy.
	Umbree: I have never been on 4chan in my life. And that is simply how I avoid the pr0nz and the /b/ tards
	Trigger: And for the most part just making themselves look like fools
	Trigger: Especially with that "sony boycott/protest" thing they tried doing
	Umbree: Amputations lawl
	anon404: the problem with 4chan today is the fact that there have been so much publicity given to it, that so many new people have started lurking
	Umbree: Uhm
	anon404: and the problem with people is that they are ignorant to really look at how the past used to be...
	Umbree: Correction, 4chan has pretty much always had problems, lol.
	Trigger: The only people I ever hear actually mention 4chan are underaged. Honestly.
	Umbree: Same
	anon404: and so they just try to live up to the image of today and just create moar cancer because that is all they see today
	anon404: i am 19. lol
	anon404: started when i was 17 or 16
	anon404: i cant remember
	elvira: I'm glad we are all geezers. back in my day, kiddo, anon was reallllyyy sumfin
	Umbree: I'm a geezer allllright
	anon404: I think anon still can be a powerful force...
	Umbree: The most geezer of them all.
	anon404: but not near what it used to be...
	Trigger: But you're talking about it in a smarter way. Other's I've talked to are just like "/b/ rullz lurk moar"
	Umbree: I think anon is more powerful mentally than physically, or forecefull.
	Umbree: *forcefully
	Umbree: They have a god-complex
	Trigger: problem is that anon doesn't care anymore
	anon404: yeah
	Umbree: And it's amusing to observe.
	Trigger: or at least a lot of it doesn't
	anon404: motivation is the hardest thing to get anon to have...
	heyman: hey
	Trigger: force memes and talk about nothing most of the time
	anon404: sup man
	heyman: LOL
	anon404: my favorite meme is fbf...
	Umbree: i use memes here and there
	Umbree: But only the ones i find amusing
	heyman: soo.

	elvira: I want everyone to know that the correct answer to this one is me, Elvira
	heyman: REGULAR SHOW
	Trigger: facebook is ruining any new memes
	Umbree: Oh man

	Umbree: Now I have that Hey man, Nice Shot song stuck in my head
	elvira: hipsterfag over here, yeah
	Trigger: I avoid tumblr at all costs
	anon404: idk. I hate the fuck out of reddit...

	heyman: facepalm
	Umbree: "If you want to make it in the music business, you have to have that special something. That sound that makes you unique and like nobody else. Hi, I'm Nick Jonas."
	Umbree: I stopped right there and died

	Tamponqueen: I'm getting $500 for programming it.
	TamponKing: Thats sweet
	Tamponqueen: It's really hard these days to find someone willing to make something in Java for you for only $500
	TamponKing: I wouldn't know I'm not a programer I'm a part time nanny so I don't mak that much 
	Tamponqueen: People pay you $3000 for you to make someone a blog
	TamponKing: Looks like I'm in the wrong buissnes
	Tamponqueen: It takes years to learn
	Tamponqueen: But the blog could be made in, like, 5 hours

	Tamponqueen: And only takes simple HTML
	Tamponqueen: With some CSS and PHP
	TamponKing: Oh really 
	Tamponqueen: But I haven't gotten a job doing it yet

	TamponKing: Yeah 
	Tamponqueen: I remember playing this game with my Russian Friend
	TamponKing: if you can actually keep up the blog I've tried to blog but I can't do it 
	Tamponqueen: I'd cheat by always taking back my "A Cheap Motel" card, and then always replaying it when it was his turn

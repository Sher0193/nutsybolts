	<p>Welcome to <b>Nutty Bolts</b>, the game of crazy comparisons!  Here's a little primer on the game rules.</p>
	
	<h3>Game Setup</h3>
	<p>The objects of interest in Nutty Bolts are <b>noun cards</b>, such as Al Gore, San Francisco, and pirates, and <b>adjective cards</b>, such as funny, tolerant, smart, and awesome.  Each round, one adjective card is picked, and one player is chosen to be the judge for that adjective.</p> 
	
	<h3>As a normal player</h3>
	<p>If you are not the judge, you must choose one of the seven noun cards in your hand.  This noun should correspond to the adjective for the round - for instance, if "angry" is the adjective, try to pick a noun that is angry - but keep in mind who the judge is this round!  The judge will not be able to determine which card is yours until after the voting is done.</p>
	
	<h3>As a judge</h3>
	<p>When it's your turn to be the judge, you wait until everyone else plays a noun card.  Then, based on the adjective for this round, pick the noun card that you think best fits the adjective.  Or, go with the card that you like the best.  You're the judge - it's your game!  Either way, the player that played the noun card you choose gets a point.</p>
